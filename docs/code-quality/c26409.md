# C26409 NO_NEW_DELETE

> `Avoid calling new and delete explicitly, use std::make_unique<T> instead (r.11).`

Even if code is clean of calls to` malloc()` and `free()`, we still suggest that you consider better options than explicit use of operators [`new` and `delete`](/cpp/cpp/new-and-delete-operators).

**C++ Core Guidelines**:\
[R.11: Avoid calling new and delete explicitly](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#r11-avoid-calling-new-and-delete-explicitly)

The ultimate fix is to use smart pointers and appropriate factory functions, such as [`std::make_unique`](/cpp/standard-library/memory-functions#make_unique).

## Remarks

- The checker warns on calls to any kind of operator **`new`** or **`delete`**: scalar, vector, overloaded versions (global and class-specific), and placement versions. The placement **`new`** case may require some clarifications in the Core Guidelines for suggested fixes, and may be omitted in the future.

## Example

This example shows C26409 is raised for explicit **`new`** and **`delete`**. Consider using smart pointer factory functions such as `std::make_unique` instead.

```cpp
void f(int i)
{
    int* arr = new int[i]{}; // C26409, warning is issued for all new calls
    delete[] arr;            // C26409, warning is issued for all delete calls

    auto unique = std::make_unique<int[]>(i); // prefer using smart pointers over new and delete
} 
```
